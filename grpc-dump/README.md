# grpc-dump

`grpc-dump` intercepts all gRPC requests and responses and logs all the request metadata in a JSON stream.

These streams can be used for all sorts of applications including:
* Debugging what requests are being made by an application and to which servers.
* Using tools like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to easily filter and transform the data for analysis.
* Using [`grpc-fixture`](../grpc-fixture/README.md) to intercept future gRPC requests from the application and replay the responses saved in the dump.
* Using [`grpc-replay`](../grpc-replay/README.md) to replay the requests exactly as the client made them and check that the server still responds the same way.

## Command line interface
```
Usage of grpc-dump:
  -cert string
    	Certificate file to use for serving using TLS.
  -destination string
    	Destination server to forward requests to if no destination can be inferred from the request itself. This is generally only used for clients not supporting HTTP proxies.
  -key string
    	Key file to use for serving using TLS.
  -port int
    	Port to listen on.
  -proto_descriptors string
    	A comma separated list of proto descriptors to load gRPC service definitions from.
  -proto_roots string
    	A comma separated list of directories to search for gRPC service definitions.
  -system_proxy
    	Automatically configure system to use this as the proxy for all connections.
```

## JSON stream output

The output of `grpc-dump` is split between stdout and stderr. Messages designed for humans (e.g. info and warning logs) are written to stderr while the machine-readable JSON stream is written to stdout.

The JSON stream is a newline separated list of JSON objects (designed to be easily processed by tools like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)).

Each message has the format:
```json5
{
  "service" : "gRPC Service name",
  "method" : "gRPC Method name",
  "messages" : [
    {
      "message_origin" : "server|client",
      "timestamp" : "RFC3339 timestamp",
      "raw_message" : "base64 encoded bytes of the raw protobuf",
      "message" : {
        // The parsed representation of the message
      }
    }
  ],
  "error" : { // present if the gRPC status is not OK
    "code" : "Status code string",
    "message" : "the gRPC error message"
  },
  "metadata" : { // the metadata present in the gRPC context
    "metadataKey" : ["metadataValue"]
  }
}
```
